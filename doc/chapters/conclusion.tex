\section{Conclusion}
After performing the Synthesis with Xilinx VIVAVO, we can say that in order to head into the \textbf{implementation} and generating the bitstream of the \textbf{Perceptron} we could use another board with an higher i/o capacity. On the other hand, we can also increase the maximum frequency of the board by adding pipeline registers in a more frequent manner (in the implementation there was a register after 3 FA modules).
