\section{Conclusion}
After performing the Synthesis with Xilinx VIVAVO, we can say that in order to head into the \textbf{implementation} and generating the bitstream of the \textbf{Perceptron} we could use another board with an higher i/o capacity. The implementation part was not executed because of the results obtained will be biased by the i/o planning constraint; in our case this would lead only to partial conclusion.\\
On the other hand, we can also increase the maximum frequency of the board by adding pipeline registers in a more frequent manner (in the implementation there was a register after 3 FA modules) with the drawback of an higher resource utilization.\\
Another optimization could be done in the adder architecture by adding some carry generation logic in order to get results with a lower number of clock cycles.
